# Team 364 Fusion CommandBaseIndex

**Subsystems**
The Command Base Index is a collection of subsystem bases for different utilizations. Every subsystem within the base can be used independently unless otherwise stated, and features placeholder values and annotations describing how to apply the subsystem.

**Commands**
Each command features notes describing the expected behavior, and the neccessary imports. Much like the subsystems, all specific values are replaced with placeholders, which are annotated to facilitate implimentation.

  **Note: This repository is a WIP, and is continuously under construction**
